.. py:function:: cluster_sizes(membership_vect)

   Get cluster sizes for a given membership vector.

   :param membership_vect: membership vector, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing cluster assignment.
   :type membership_vect: Series

   :returns: cluster sizes
   :rtype: Series


.. py:function:: links_count(membership_vect)

   Number of links associated with a given membership vector.

   There is one link for each distinct pair of elements within the same cluster.

   :param membership_vect: membership vector, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing cluster assignment.
   :type membership_vect: Series

   :returns: number of links
   :rtype: int


.. py:function:: true_positives_count(prediction, reference)

   Number of true positives for given predicted and reference clusterings.

   :param prediction: membership vector for predicted clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing predicted cluster assignment.
   :type prediction: Series
   :param reference: membership vector for reference clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing reference cluster assignment.
   :type reference: Series

   :returns: Number of true positives.
   :rtype: int


.. py:function:: false_positives_count(prediction, reference)

   Number of false positives for given predicted and reference clusterings.

   :param prediction: membership vector for predicted clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing predicted cluster assignment.
   :type prediction: Series
   :param reference: membership vector for reference clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing reference cluster assignment.
   :type reference: Series

   :returns: Number of false positives
   :rtype: int


.. py:function:: pairwise_precision(prediction, reference)

   Pairwise precision: number of correct links divided by the number of predicted links.

   :param prediction: membership vector for predicted clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing predicted cluster assignment.
   :type prediction: Series
   :param reference: membership vector for reference clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing reference cluster assignment.
   :type reference: Series

   :returns: pairwise precision
   :rtype: float


.. py:function:: pairwise_recall(prediction, reference)

   Pairwise recall: number of correct links divided by the number of reference links.

   This is the same as `pairwise_precision(reference, prediction)`.

   :param prediction: membership vector for predicted clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing predicted cluster assignment.
   :type prediction: Series
   :param reference: membership vector for reference clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing reference cluster assignment.
   :type reference: Series

   :returns: pairwise recall
   :rtype: float


.. py:function:: pairwise_precision_recall(prediction, reference)

   Pairwise precision and recall

   :param prediction: membership vector for predicted clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing predicted cluster assignment.
   :type prediction: Series
   :param reference: membership vector for reference clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing reference cluster assignment.
   :type reference: Series

   :returns: tuple (precision, recall).
   :rtype: tuple


.. py:function:: pairwise_fscore(prediction, reference, beta=1.0)

   Pairwise precision-recall f-score.

   This is indexed by a parameter `beta` representing the statement that "recall is beta times more important than precision".
   See [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) for more information.

   For beta = 1 (default value), this is the harmonic mean between precision and recall.

   :param prediction: membership vector for predicted clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing predicted cluster assignment.
   :type prediction: Series
   :param reference: membership vector for reference clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing reference cluster assignment.
   :type reference: Series
   :param beta: weight. Defaults to 1.0.
   :type beta: float

   :returns: f-score
   :rtype: float


.. py:function:: pairwise_fowlkes_mallows(prediction, reference)

   Geometric mean between pairwise precision and recall.

   See [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowlkes%E2%80%93Mallows_index) for more information.

   :param prediction: membership vector for predicted clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing predicted cluster assignment.
   :type prediction: Series
   :param reference: membership vector for reference clusters, i.e. a pandas Series indexed by mention ids and with values representing reference cluster assignment.
   :type reference: Series

   :returns: Fowlks-Mallows index
   :rtype: float
