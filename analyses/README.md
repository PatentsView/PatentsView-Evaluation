This folder contains one-time analyses that were run as experiments or for the preparation of Binette et al (2022). 

These analyses are **mostly** reproducible. However, in some cases raw data could not be shared on Github. Furthermore, breaking changes to the **pv_evaluation** package can break analyses. The analyses are not formally tested and no guarantees are provided regarding them.
